This folder includes our API code

We will be using Spoonacular API - Recipe API

After a user registers and login he/she can order food by clicking the green button

This will redirect to a page where the user is going to enter the number of calories they want to order.

Since the user is restricted to only 2000 calories per day, the allowable calories to be searched will be less than or equal to the remaining calories in that day.

The results of the search will be less than or equal to the calories searched. The user then selects an appropriate meal.

The user can also add his/her favourite recipe

He/she can then order by viewing it and making the payment.
