*SUMARRY
After a user registers and logs in he/she can order food by clicking the green button

This will redirect to a page where the user is going to enter the number of calories they want to order.

Since the user is restricted to only 2000 calories per day, the allowable calories to be searched will be less than or equal to the remaining calories in that day.

The results of the search will be less than or equal to the calories searched. The user then selects an appropriate meal.

He/she can then order by viewing it and making the payment.


When the user logs in, the user details and the timestamp of the login time is written to a text file named login_logs.txt
When the user logs out, the user details are written to a text file named logout_logs.txt
